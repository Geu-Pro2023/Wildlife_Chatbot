# WildGuard: Wildlife Conservation Chatbot

## Chatbotâ€™s Purpose
The project, WildGuard, is a domain-specific chatbot developed to address the growing need for accessible and accurate information about wildlife conservation. It is designed to assist users by providing reliable, informative responses to a wide range of queries related to environmental awareness and animal welfare. 
The chatbot covers key topics such as eco-friendly practices, animal behavior, common myths, emergencies involving wildlife, the effects of climate change on biodiversity, and opportunities for volunteering and understanding conservation laws. Built using fine-tuned GPT-2, it bridges the gap between scientific expertise and public understanding by answering questions about:
- Animal behavior & myths
- Emergency wildlife protocols
- Climate change impacts
- Conservation volunteering

## Why Choose WildGuard?
This project addresses these challenges through the development of WildGuard, a specialized chatbot that leverages cutting-edge natural language processing to provide reliable, instant access to wildlife conservation knowledge. Unlike conventional FAQ systems or decision trees, WildGuard utilizes a fine-tuned GPT-2 model that can comprehend nuanced queries and generate contextually relevant responses. 

## Dataset Overview
The foundation of WildGuard's knowledge system rests upon a meticulously curated dataset comprising 4,452 question-answer pairs spanning 14 critical conservation categories. This collection represents one of the most comprehensive wildlife-focused conversational datasets developed for AI applications, with content systematically gathered from authoritative sources.
